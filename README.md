## **Introduction**

I am an incoming Freshman at UC Berkeley. I plan to major in Molecular and Cell Biology with an emphasis in Cell and Developmental Biology. I am on the pre-med track and hope to one day become a surgeon. Aside from my studies, I like to spend quality time with my family and friends. Family is one of the most important things in my life. Furthermore, I love to go to amusement parks and ride rollercoasters. Any sort of extreme ride excites me. I also enjoy going to the beach and being outdoors in general. I love being immersed in nature and enjoy relaxing or studying outdoors. Picnic/study dates outdoors give me life.




An old song I have enjoyed listening to:
